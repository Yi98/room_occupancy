# Final Year Project
Project: Room Occupancy System


# Roadmap
## Week 1
- have a brief meeting with the supervisor (Brian) 
- further clarification on the project requirement to be confirmed soon
- we did some research related to this project (solution, pros and cons)


## Week 2
- Decided which solution to choose.
- Research on the solution such as the hardware needed and software components involve.
- Meet with supervisor to discuss more on the selected solution and get suggestion and feedbacks from supervisor.
- Preparing Project Plan draft.

## Week 3
- Finished Project Plan and submit.
- Drafting the Software Requirements Specifications.
- Decided which hardware components needed for the solution product.
- Decided the software tools that will be used for creating the software, web application.
- Design the whole system architecture and design including the overall architecture diagram (hardware and software), the tree diagram     for software, and the database entity diagram.

## Week 4
- Meet with client alongside with supervisor to have more understanding on the requirements.
- Ammend client's opinion and requirements for the product into the SRS.
- Reach aggreement with client by having them sign-off the SRS.
- Decided the specific hardware models needed for the product and purchase the hardware.
- Design the backlog items for the software.
- Configure and assemble the hardware components, consisted of Raspberry Pi, Sensor and WiFi & Bluetooth module.
- Distribute tasks among teammates:
  1. Ng Yi - Software backend design and implementation.
  2. Ng Chin Shu - Frontend design and functionality for the Dashboard and Chart module.
  3. Florence Teo - Frontend design and functionality for the Login, Forgot Password and User module.
  4. Bong Jin Hong - Programming for Sensor (BME280), WiFi & Bluetooth module (ESP32) and Microprocessor (Raspberry Pi 4 Model B).

## Week 5
- Database has been created and hosted on temporary Cloud services.
- RESTful API Backend has been implemented and interact with the database successfully.
- Sensor are able to send temperature and humidity data to web server to be stored in database and display it in Frontend in real time.
- Raspberry Pi 4 able to stream in real-time and process, however the accuracy is low, need to be improvised.
- Majority of the frontend has been created successfully such as the layouts and basic functionality of the software.
- Each member working on the Self-Learning Summary Report, Team documentation and Peer Review.
